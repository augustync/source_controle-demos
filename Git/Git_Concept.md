# Git Concept

### Git repository contains file, history, files used to manage Git.
### Three States of Git:
* Working directory
* Staging area -- pre-commit holding area
* Commit --  Git Repository (history)

### Local
#### Working directory
Contain project files, but not only, however git is aware of them

#### Staging Area
Its where git queues all changes which werent commited yet

#### Repository (.git folder)
Its where git queues all commits
Commits - Git history.

### Remote
Its the last step in the basic git repository state

### Master Branch
Its the last concept in the git
Branches works like the others sorces control changes

In Git branches contain commits , the default branch at the bgining its MASTER
